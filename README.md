## Data Description


## Questions and Importance

What type of crime is most prevalent for each age group in New York?

Importance: Based on the data evaluation this question is relevant because it can help law-enforcement officers identify trends and use this to prevent future crimes by staying equipped. By analyzing this data through age group officials can address root causes and provide these problems with adequate solutions. To depict this visually we chose to create bar charts for different data groups so officials can see what kind of crimes are happening and how they can effectively put a stop to it.


Over the course of 2021 to 2023, what is the trend of arrests for each location based on borough for age group 25-44?

Importance: To enhance our data analysis, we narrowed our focus to the age group with the highest number of arrests, which was 25-44. We then delved deeper by examining trends in crime rates within this age group across different boroughs. This analysis is significant because it could allow us to explore potential correlations between crime rates and various factors such as population demographics and economic conditions in the future.

## Manipulations

In order to ensure understanding of our data visualizations, a calculated field was created to translate the codes for the boroughs into the full names of them. This way when looking at the line chart, it can be easily understood which borough is which line. We also filtered by month and used the color feature to distinguish the boroughs, as well. Additionally, the team chose to forecast the data to identify potential trends in the future.
